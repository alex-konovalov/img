<h3>5 <span class="Heading">IMG implementation details</span></h3>

<p><strong class="pkg">IMG</strong> creates new categories for the various objects considered in the package. The first category is ...</p>

<p><a id="X7F8F64548143DF99" name="X7F8F64548143DF99"></a></p>

<h4>5.1 <span class="Heading">Marked spheres</span></h4>

<p><strong class="pkg">FR</strong> contains algorithms that convert a rational function (with floating-point complex coefficients) to an IMG machine and back.</p>

<p>Consider a rational map <span class="SimpleMath">f</span> of degree <span class="SimpleMath">d</span>. First, compute the post-critical set <span class="SimpleMath">P_f</span>; this is done by iterating <span class="SimpleMath">f</span> on critical points, and considering points at angle at most <span class="SimpleMath">EPS@.prec</span> from each other as equal.</p>

<p>Then construct a spherical Delaunay triangulation <span class="SimpleMath">T</span> on <span class="SimpleMath">P_f</span>; and choose in it a minimal spanning tree; edges of that tree represent a generating set of the fundamental group <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> of <span class="SimpleMath">S^2∖ P_f</span>.</p>

<p>Lift first through <span class="SimpleMath">f</span> the edges of the dual tree in the dual tesselation of <span class="SimpleMath">T</span>; they will form <span class="SimpleMath">d</span> connected subgraphs, numbered <span class="SimpleMath">1,...,d</span>. Lift then the edges crossing the minimal spanning tree, and read the elements of <span class="SimpleMath">F</span> that their lifts represent, as well as the subgraphs they start and end in. This data describes an FR machine.</p>

<p>Choose then for each vertex in <span class="SimpleMath">P_f</span> an adjacent face in <span class="SimpleMath">T/</span>. This choice defines a generating family of <span class="SimpleMath">F</span> made up, for each vertex, of a path in the dual tree starting at a basepoint, a sequence of edges around a vertex starting at the chosen face, and a path back in the dual tree. The product, in an appropriate order, of these generators describes an IMG machine.</p>

<p>There is an epimorphism from the group <span class="SimpleMath">G</span>, generated by these loops around vertices, to <span class="SimpleMath">F</span>; and this epimorphism becomes an isomorphism if one adds to <span class="SimpleMath">G/</span> the relation "product of generators in an appropriate order". Such a triangulation, with a given group <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> and a homomorphism from <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> to <span class="SimpleMath">F</span>, is called a <em>spider</em>.</p>

<p>The inverse algorithm is quite similar. Consider an IMG machine <span class="SimpleMath">M</span>, with stateset <span class="SimpleMath">G</span>. Start by a "standard" set of points on the sphere, one per generator of <span class="SimpleMath">M</span>, and construct a spider <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> on them. Find a rational map <span class="SimpleMath">f</span> with critical values at the vertices of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> and monodromy given by the activities of <span class="SimpleMath">M</span>, and lift <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> to a spider <span class="SimpleMath">T</span>, marked by a group <span class="SimpleMath">H</span>. The lifting gives a homomorphism <span class="SimpleMath">f^*:G-&gt; H≀ Sym(d)</span>.</p>

<p>By appropriately relabeling the alphabet, one can ensure that this homomorphism coincides with <span class="SimpleMath">M</span>'s recursion at the first level. Furthermore, it identifies each vertex <span class="SimpleMath">v_i</span> of <span class="SimpleMath">T</span> either with a vertex <span class="SimpleMath">w_j</span> of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span>, if for some <span class="SimpleMath">g∈ G</span> a state in <span class="SimpleMath">M</span> of <span class="SimpleMath">g</span> is a conjugate <span class="SimpleMath">g_j</span>, while the corresponding entry of <span class="SimpleMath">f^*(g)</span> is a conjugate of <span class="SimpleMath">h_i</span>.</p>

<p>Construct then a new triangulation <span class="SimpleMath">S'</span> by keeping only those vertices of <span class="SimpleMath">T</span> that were identified, and mapping them by a Möbius transformation <span class="SimpleMath">μ</span> to "standard position". This means that the barycenter of the points is <span class="SimpleMath">0∈ R^3</span>, that the last point goes to <span class="SimpleMath">∞</span>, and that the next-to-last goes to <span class="SimpleMath">R_+</span>. Letting <span class="SimpleMath">F</span> denote the group on the minimal spanning tree of <span class="SimpleMath">S'</span>, there is a homomorphism <span class="SimpleMath">μ_*:H-&gt; F</span>.</p>

<p>The decomposition <span class="SimpleMath">ϕ</span> of <span class="SimpleMath">M</span> then produces a homomorphism <span class="SimpleMath">m:G-&gt; F</span> such that <span class="SimpleMath">μ_*f^*=mϕ</span>. This turns <span class="SimpleMath">S'</span> into a spider on <span class="SimpleMath">G</span>. Iterate then this process with <span class="SimpleMath">S'</span>.</p>

<p>Either the spiders <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> converge, and then <span class="SimpleMath">μ^-1f</span> is the desired rational function; or there is a Thurston obstruction, which is a non-contracting multicurve. Seek therefore clusters of vertices that are very close from each other, and compute the curve going around them; this defines a conjugacy class in <span class="SimpleMath">G</span>. In <span class="SimpleMath">M</span>, compute the iterated decomposition of this curve, and its associated transition matrix. If it has spectrum at least <span class="SimpleMath">1</span>, return the multicurve as an obstruction; otherwise, continue.</p>
